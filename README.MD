# Terra 3D
***My swift student challenge submission***

### The Journey
After countless hours spent and only five hours of sleep in the last two days, it is finally over.  

Why did I push myself to participate in this challenge despite not knowing Swift? I don’t know. But I guess I wanted to feel challenged. I felt like I was becoming too comfortable, too complacent—doing very little to reach where I hoped to be.  

Finally, a journey that started on January 6th has come to an end.  

> 20 Chrome tabs open on my laptop right now.  
> 49 tabs open in my Terra 3D tab group on my phone's Safari browser.  
> Another 37 open (not in any tab group).  
> Over 400 hours of research and coding because I had no idea what I was doing.  
> _(This is not an exaggerated number—I’m actually being conservative.)_  

_But do I think I’ll win?_ Probably not. If it's about code quality, my chances are long gone. A complete app? Barely. It just scrapes by under the "it just works" mark. My essays and submission? Hacked together in ten minutes because I spent too much time on the code. I wish I had spent more time on the essays.  

How am I supposed to communicate with them now? How do I tell them that I only started programming three and a half years ago? That I only started learning Swift because of this challenge? That I want to be an inspiration to those who think it's too late to start?  
I remember watching videos of kids who "dreamed in code" while I hadn’t even written my first line. But here we are.  

I didn’t do this alone, though. For a majority of my motivation to complete this challenge, I have [Daniella Michel](https://github.com/daniellamichel) to thank.  

Well it is not the best, but I tried **my** best.
