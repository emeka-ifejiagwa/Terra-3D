/// Stores the global green house gas concentration

/// GHGs first, because that global level modifies the temperature in the next step.
//Global Temperature next, because itâ€™s needed for rainfall/climate updates.
//Local Rainfall: updated after we know the new temperature that might shift rainfall distribution.
//Water Flow depends on how much new rainfall arrived.
//Erosion depends on water flow.
//Vegetation depends on final climate, water availability, and terrain changes.
//Pollution last, because it might also be transported via water flow or wind. If you incorporate advanced logic that wind depends on temperature changes, you might do a mini feedback loop, but the typical approach is to place it after the climate and flow steps to incorporate new conditions.
